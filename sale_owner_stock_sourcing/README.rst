Sale Owner Stock Sourcing
=========================

This module allow you to choose for every sale order line the owner of the stock that will be dispatched.
By choosing an owner, the generated deliveries will then look for stock of the specified partner.
If no one is available, then the picking will be in waiting availability until stocks of the proper ownership
are replenished.

Specifying an owner on a line, forces to use the stock of this owner.
Letting the owner empty allows to use stock (quant) without owner.
